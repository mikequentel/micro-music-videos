## About

 * Slideshow of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, based on publicly-available images, with music from _Goldie: The Alchemist: the Best of 1992-2012_, by Goldie.
 * Includes a prologue of the voice of Duke Ellington, an introduction to his song, _Single Petal of a Rose_
 
## Why
 
 * As an admirer of Queen Elizabeth II, I wanted to combine the music of Goldie's tune with beautiful pictures of the Queen.
 
## Tools
 
The following tools were used to create this:

 * youtube-dl to download the song _Single Petal of a Rose_ from the video [Goldie - Single Petal Of A Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31XQlALAz0I) as an mp4
 * Audacity to extract the music from the mp4 to an mp3, then also to extract the prologue of Duke Ellington.
 * kden to create a slideshow.
